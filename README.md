 ## üîé About

A recent graduate of a top European coding bootcamp and a renowned software engineering degree program funded by Santander. Winner of the Google 2022 Project Data Hack and has worked with two web3 startups backed by VCs Meta and Seedcamp. Passionate about using technology for solving problems with customer-focused products.

## ü§ù Strengths (Soft Skills)

* ### Problem Solver (First Principles Thinker)

I enjoy the challenge of solving real world problems which is what initiallly drew me to programming. It has enabled me to work proactively and collaboratively across all stages of the software development lifecycle to build digital products. I prefer to think about problems that are related to the barriers between people and technology. Along with how I can leverage my programming skills to help create a seamless digital future with like-minded individuals. 

This skill was demonstrated most notably, when I spearheaded the development of the Rodheads NFT project. Where I figured out how to generate 2440 Dennis Rodman inspired NFTs in a week using React, TypeScript, Rust and Solana. This was then used as part of a pitch to Dennis Rodman and his management team. The promotional video of the NFTs I generated can be found here ‚Üí <a href="https://twitter.com/ThrillDAO/status/1470752410771595265">
Rodheads</a>.


* ### Autodidact (Self-Learner)

I consider myself an autodidact as I did not take the conventional route of learning computer science by going to university. In 2017, I was awarded one of 14 positions in Santander's 2017 Technology Degree Apprenticeship program. For high-achieving, diverse talent out of more than 900 applications nationwide. Where I programmed the internal learning and mentoring platform. Which grew to 250+ engineers as users. Along with improving the UX for 30 internal product teams. In both cases, teaching myself and learning TypeScript and Angular on the job. 

I also demonstrated this skill while working on a side project I co-founded called <a href="https://github.com/davidmeadejr/divvy-app"> Divvy</a>. Which is an iOS bill-splitting app where I learned React Native and built 8 components along with 6 screens and routing to handle the user flow. It was presented to over 80 attendees at a full-stack software engineering bootcamp demo day. Where it received overwhelmingly positive feedback.

* ### Builder (Proactive)

I am innovative and data-driven with standout complex problem-solving skills. I also enjoy building with like-minded individuals so you can often find me participating in hackathons. Putting these skills to use in 2022 at Google. Where I was one of the top 30 underrepresented thinkers in the UK out of over more than 100 candidates. Where I co-founded Nudgewell, a personalised money-saving and wellness app. Aimed at helping homeowners and housemates during the cost of living crisis. Where I created the initial screens and routing using React Native. While also interacting with the application's backend built with Python and Django.
