## ü§ù Strengths (Soft Skills)

* ### Collaboration
During my time at Santander and my work on web3 projects, I have effectively collaborated on FinTech, Academic, and web3 projects with diverse teams. For example, at Santander, I accelerated the delivery of front-end tickets by utilising Agile methodology and Angular for scalability, resulting in the innovation team achieving their targets. I also enhanced engineer collaboration by helping to build an in-house learning platform using Angular and TypeScript. This collaborative approach has enabled me to contribute to smooth project execution and foster productive team relationships.


* ### Adaptability
In the ever-evolving world of software engineering, I have consistently demonstrated my adaptability by swiftly learning and applying modern technologies such as TypeScript and React. For instance, when working on a group project that required proficiency in JavaScript and React Native, I leveraged my software engineering background and transferable skills from other languages to effectively build the entire frontend of the mobile app within just eight days. This adaptability has been crucial for ensuring project success and keeping up with the rapid pace of technological advancements.

* ### Problem Solving
Throughout my career, I have tackled various technical challenges, fixed code bugs, and improved product performance in multiple projects. At Santander, When working in the Chief Data Office, one responsibility included managing company metadata spreadsheets, which required diligent attention to detail and organisation. By efficiently updating and managing these spreadsheets, I ensured data accuracy and provided senior management with valuable insights. 

In another instance, whilst working on a frontend project to create the v1 website using React, I faced a challenging issue concerning state management, leading to complications and reduced performance. The challenge involved finding an efficient solution to manage the complex state of the application, enhance overall performance, and successfully complete the v1 website. In response, I researched a variety of state management techniques and libraries, ultimately choosing to implement Redux for effective application state management. I studied the Redux documentation and integrated it into the project, refactoring existing components to work with the Redux store. Consequently, the application's performance improved considerably, and the state-related issues were resolved. The completed v1 website functioned as a central hub for company information, offering valuable insights to VCs and consumers while facilitating a smoother user experience and easier maintainability for the development team.

* ### Initiative
I have always been proactive in seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and contribute to projects. I have participated in hackathons, where I transformed original ideas into technical proof-of-concepts. Also, In pursuit of opportunities in the FinTech sector, I sought roles within both centralised and decentralised financial domains. The challenge lay in acquiring relevant experience in the FinTech web3 industry. To achieve this, I dedicated 4.5 years to working at a large corporate bank and nearly a year at two web3 FinTech start-ups. As a result, I gained substantial experience and became well-versed in the FinTech industry.

* ### Time Management
I have demonstrated my exceptional time management skills by successfully balancing a full-time FinTech apprenticeship, a technology degree, and a weekend retail job for 4.5 years. I achieved this by prioritising tasks, managing my time effectively, and maintaining focus on my various responsibilities. My ability to multitask in a time-sensitive environment has been instrumental in meeting deadlines and achieving my goals.
